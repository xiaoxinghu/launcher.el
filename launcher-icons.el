;;; launcher-icons.el --- Native macOS app icons for launcher -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Each app's own icon, as macOS draws it, before its name in the
;; launcher's list.
;;
;; The packaged script assets/launcher-icons.js asks AppKit for icons
;; (NSWorkspace iconForFile:) through macOS's built-in osascript, and
;; writes them as PNGs, in the background.  A PNG's name is a hash of
;; the app's path and of its Info.plist's modification time, so that an
;; updated app gets a new icon, and making missing PNGs is all there is
;; to do.  An icon that is not ready yet shows as blank space.
;;
;; Loading this file starts nothing: icons are made when a graphical
;; launcher asks for them.
