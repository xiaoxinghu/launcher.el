#+TITLE: launcher.el

Launch macOS applications from Emacs.

* Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package launcher
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/launcher.el" :rev :newest))
#+end_src

* Usage

- ~M-x launcher~ — pick and launch an app
- ~C-u M-x launcher~ — rebuild index first
- ~M-x launcher-refresh~ — rebuild index without launching

If input matches no app, falls back to a web search (~launcher-fallback-search-url~).

* Works with [[https://github.com/xiaoxinghu/m-x][M-x.app]]

M-x.app registers the ~emacs://~ URL scheme, letting you invoke Elisp from a global hotkey anywhere on macOS. Bind it to =cmd + space=, you get a system-wide app launcher — Raycast-style, but in Emacs.

* Roadmap

This is part of a broader effort to replace Raycast with Emacs.

** TODO *Bang commands*
~!g query~, ~!gh repo~, ~!yt video~ to redirect input to configurable URL templates
** TODO *Custom commands*
register named elisp actions alongside apps via ~launcher-register-command~
** TODO *Built-in extensions*
calculator, clipboard history, window management, system commands (sleep/lock/restart), file search, quick links, snippets
